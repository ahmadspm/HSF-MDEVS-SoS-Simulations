This Tranformations are prototyped for SoS coalitions which are first described in HSF and then mapping is done to be more compatible to DEVS SES. 

It is important to note that some code snipptes need to added manually, for example HSF does not have an Experimental Framee while DEVS has. Similarly DEVS does not support connectors
while HSF supports as core Architecural Element.
