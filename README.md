# HSF-MDEVS-SoS-Simulations

This repository contains Abstract models for expriementing HSF with MARKOV Discrevent Event Sysems Specifications (DEVS) which is a Markovian description of DEVS. The Simulations are done using formal transformation methods aided with Model Driven Engineeirng. 

HSF code is transformed from CSs and SOS coalitionS for DEVS and SES from HSF.  

There are certain limitations in terms of Transformation as MDEVS and HSF have certian differences . Howeever, formal transofrmation rules assist for one to one mapping.

Synthatic Datasets are genrated for SoS coalition1 and Coalition2 for performing various Software Architecural Analysis such as:
Mission completion Analysis
SoS Behaviour Analysis
SoS coalitions conformance to system requirements during missions

This is unique apparoch exploring SoS Dynamics using Markovian Semantics specifically adopted for Software Architecure Models.
