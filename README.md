# HSF-MDEVS-SoS-Simulations

This repository contains Abstract models for expriementing HSF with MARKOVE DEVES whihc is a Markovian description of DEVS. 

The Simulations are done using formal transformation methods aideded with Model Driven Engineeirng. 

HSF code is transformed from CSs to smaple coalition for DEVS and SES. 

There are certain limitations in terms of Transformation as MDEVS and HSF have certian differences. Howeever, formal transofrmation assists one to one mapping.

Synthatic Data sets are genrated for SoS coalition1 and Coalition2
